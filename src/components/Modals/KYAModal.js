            Night Owl Casino offers a form of added security, as buyers and
            sellers do not have to give their information to any 3rd party.
            However, Night Owl is without a Know Your Customer (KYC) process and
            can offer NO assistance if a user is hacked or cheated out of
            passwords, currency or private wallet keys.
